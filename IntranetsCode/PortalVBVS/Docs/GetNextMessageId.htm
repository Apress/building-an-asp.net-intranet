            <i>Discussion:</i>
        &nbsp;Each record in the Discussion table is a message in a threaded 
        discussion, as displayed by the Discussion Portal Module. Since all Discussion 
        modules store their record in this table, each item contains a ModuleID to 
        permit related items to be retrieved in a single query.
        <p>
        An especially interesting feature of the Discussion table is the DisplayOrder 
        field, which is used to create the threaded display of messages in the 
        discussion. This field is calculated by concatenating a 23-character string 
        representation of the current date and time to the DisplayOrder for this item's 
        parent. In this way, messages can be displayed in the correct order via a 
        simple ascending sort. This approach has an inherent limitation based upon the 
        size of the DisplayOrder field. In this case it's 750 characters, meaning that 
        messages nested more than 32 levels deep will not display in the correct order.
        <p>
        The primary key in this table is the ItemID identity field. Note that message 
        bodies are limited to 3000 characters.
