        <P>
            <i>Events:</i>
        &nbsp;Each record in the Events table is a single item, as displayed by the 
        Events Portal Module. Since all Events modules store their record in this 
        table, each item contains a ModuleID to permit related items to be retrieved in 
        a single query.
        <p>
        The primary key in this table is the ItemID identity field. Note that event 
        descriptions are limited to 2000 characters.
