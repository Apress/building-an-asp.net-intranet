            <i>Announcements:</i>
        &nbsp;Each record in the Announcements table is a single item, as displayed by 
        the Announcements Portal Module. Since all Announcement modules store their 
        record in this table, each item contains a ModuleID to permit related items to 
        be retrieved in a single query.
        <p>
        The primary key in this table is the ItemID identity field. Note that 
        announcement descriptions are limited to 2000 characters.
