        &nbsp;Each record in the Links table is a hyperlink, as displayed by the Links 
        Portal Module. Since all Links modules store their record in this table, each 
        item contains a ModuleID to permit related items to be retrieved in a single 
        query.
        <p>
        The primary key in this table is the ItemID identity field. Note that the link 
        description is limited to 4000 characters.
